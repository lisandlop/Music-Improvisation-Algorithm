# Music-Improvisation-Algorithm
Algorithm for music improvisation. Coded in Max/MSP. 

An algorithm that reacts and improvises music together with a human double bass musician, in a synchronised way. The improvisational method called "Flocker" has been used. 

Video example: https://vimeo.com/379138562
 
The algorithmic improvisation is heard in the video first as computer-like sounds, and thereafter as piano sounds. There have been coded two parallell algorithms interacting with the musician in different sounds, thereby the different sounds. 
  
Coded in Max/MSP, together with three other colleagues, where my role was as lead programmer (2019).

In collaboration with KMH Royal College of Music in Stockholm (Sweden).
